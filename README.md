# MNIST Dataset Analysis

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks for solving questions 1 and 2 of the Machine Learning Homework 2.
Question 1 is about PCA Analysis, and question 2 is about Logistic regression and hyperparameter tuning.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebooks, make sure you have the dependencies installed:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Getting Started
 Open the Jupyter notebooks `Question1.ipynb` and `Question2.ipynb` in your Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Question 1

The comments describe the relevant subquestion in the `q1.ipynb` notebook. 
But before running any subquestion, the code pieces before Question1.1 should be run.

## Question 2

The comments describe the relevant subquestion in the `q2.ipynb` notebook. 
However, subquestion 2.5 for discussing performance metrics is directly added to the code.
Before running any subquestion, the code pieces before Question 2.1 should be run.
The default parameters are initialized for each plot to avoid unwanted values.
