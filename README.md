# Machine Learning Homework 2

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks for solving questions 1 and 2 of the Machine Learning Homework 2.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebooks, make sure you have the dependencies installed:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Getting Started
 Open the Jupyter notebooks `Question1.ipynb` and `Question2.ipynb` in your Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Question 1

In the `q1.ipynb` notebook, the relevant subquestion is described in the comments. 
But before running any subquestion, the code pieces before Question1.1 should be run.

## Question 2

In the `q2.ipynb` notebook, the relevant subquestion is described in the comments. 
However, the subquestion 2.5 for discussing performance metrics is directly added to the code.
Before running any subquestion, the code pieces before Question2.1 should be run.
For each plot, the default parameters are initialized again, to avoid any unwanted values.
